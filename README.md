This project is done by WZAutomation to demonstrate the functionalities of TIA Openness.
This project is a simple demonstration of the functionalities of TIA Openness, it is quite distant from a usable project generator and is not meant to be one.
Because of the focus on the TIA Openness functionalities, this project doesn't fully follow the object oriented programming rules, you will see many corner cuts.
Unhandled exceptions are everywhere, don't even bring them up.

New features are coming to this project depending on how many sports I play and how many drinks I have every day.
If you need any help with your TIA Openness project or anything related to SIEMENS Digital Enterprise products, you can contact me at contact@wzautomation.com
